Group 1:
Display offset of detected circle to center of image
Variable dilated and eroded until circle is detected
Not always needed to erode and dilate so make it variable

Q: why are you dilating eroding vs opposite way, 
justify the processing?

Q: Circle Method? A :  Using Hough circle detection

Q: Why 35? A: Manually tuned

Group 2:
Processing a lot of removeable data,
morpholigical transformation
 make mask and remove edges which are not useful
rejecting false positives
Q: try fitting ransac for straight lines?
Q: only looking for one circle?

Group 3:
Template matching openCV, gets difference of parts of image.
Doesntt find angle of change

Q: what if part missing? A: not robust. use a grid of templates

Q: How does it work? 

Group 4:

Group 5:
Bilateral-erosion-cannyedge-circle hough

What cirlce hough?


Group 6:
PIXL 12mm focul length (xi/f)=x/z

Edge detection method?
Put a center of the image cross hair
