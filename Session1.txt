1- Terrain relative navigation

Scaling factor relating to the distance from the surface.

2 - Shape (circle based) navigation

Distance to surface can be used to approximate the size of the circle in the image

Scene analysis is important- 3 pages in the start of the report - Where are we, what are the conditions (lighting, etc),
elaborate problem statement, noise and signal ratios, which parameters are important to recreate. compare real world parameters with
test setup and scale if needed (focal length difference between rover and lab)


output parameters from scence analysis



80-90 pages report

Distance can be taken as given (variation in feature size may be useful for relative distance measurement)
Find constallation 
Find edges of circle
Output the position of camera

Robustness of solution - No false positive, no variance with different conditions in lighting, colours, surfaces

Natural object output -  xyz, pitch angles, yaw etc

Account for different lighting conditions - grey calibration object to detect illumination
