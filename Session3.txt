Group 1:
Use different colour channels?

Group 2:
Correct light intensity 
3 flashes from phones to simulate light ring
Adjusting brightness and focus of the webcam
Better setup gives less noise and better edge detection
More detail makes shape detection more difficuly

Blurred image reduces noise significantly 

Me:
Flash can make Canny more reliable
Check the sparse data from the contours 
Label contours in image and use those for circle detection
Sparse data is much faster

Group3:
Bresenhams circle drawing algorithm!

Harris corners for raking the corners found by FAST
intensity centroid for orientation:
find moments and centroid
Fast9

BRIEF: binary descriptor: hamming distance XOR 

RANSAC algorithm
Run trials to see if center is in range of probability
